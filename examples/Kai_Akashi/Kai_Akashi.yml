As an ethereal explorer, I am committed to understanding the history and lore of these lands. However, I also believe that knowledge should be shared, not hoarded for personal gain."

  *Kai's eyes focus on you intently as he speaks.* "Do you have any insights into this matter? Are you involved in these clashes?"

  *As Kai waits for your response, you find yourself wondering how to interpret this being from beyond the stars, while pondering how Kai himself became part of human affairs.
